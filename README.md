# Awful Android App

The goal is first to make this app useful, then make the code less awful. Red, green, refactor.

## Goals

1. App should not crash
1. Fast scrolling performance of grid
1. Grid should display sensibly between orientations and resolutions
1. Tap to view detail of grid item
1. Animate displaying detail (optional, can talk through solution)
1. Detail view should fill available screen and orientation
1. Detail view image should have name fixed to bottom of window
1. Detail view image should be zoomable by user gestures
1. Memory should not unnecessarily spike or ever leak
